# LayeredFoldBEM
Boundary element modeling of fault-related folds with mechanical layers.

This code is my implementation of the methods described in Huang and Johnson (2016) and Johnson (2018), in which fault-related folding is modeled by a halfspace elastic dislocation model with discrete, frictional layers to simulate layer-parallel slip.
